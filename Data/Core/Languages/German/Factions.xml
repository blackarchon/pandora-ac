	<entry name="GaiansDescription" value="The Earth-founded organization that became Terra Salvum started out as an array of pressure-groups, scattered over the planet, in the late 20th century. As the 21st century progressed and the climate collapsed, they won more supporters to their cause, especially in the areas where natural resources were being over-exploited -- Africa, South America and parts of Asia -- as well as in liberal parts of the west.<br/><br/>Gradually, the organizations realized that the only way to talk to governments was to match their size. In the 2040s, following a decade of terrorism and warfare that scarred Earth, these pressure groups merged into Terra Salvum, using their combined influence and financial power to make their opinions count just as much as the corporations. Their more-militant arm became especially feared in international waters.<br/><br/>When Pandora was discovered, Terra Salvum didn't have the finances to buy one of Noxium's terrifyingly-expensive cruise-colonizers. Thankfully with the aid of developing world hackers, the organization managed to 'acquire' the blueprints for the ships. Friendly scientists donated their lives to rapidly decode these and the resources of a small nation were poured into building a single colony ship. However, the organization simply couldn't afford the extra cost of building enough hibernation units and radiation shielding before launch -- so they didn't.<br/><br/>Given their exposure to hard radiation during the transit to Pandora, most of the adult ecologists sickened and died, leaving a crew of young, fervent green warriors growing up on the ship, most of whom had never seen an Earth flower. On landing, the young Vivian Gardinier, daughter of the former leader Elora, was appointed as her mother's replacement. Her peaceful followers -- after more than two decades of imprisonment on a radiation-riddled spaceship -- long for a living world and are determined that the war for natural resources which bled old Earth white will never happen on Pandora.

	<entry name="EconomicDescription" value="No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that Earth was being controlled keenly and closely by intelligences more subtle than most men's. The Noxium Corporation didn't exist then, of course. But the handful of greedy men who valued their own happiness more highly than that of a thousand others had existed since the 17th century.<br/><br/>The slow cartelization of most economic markets really took off in the 19th century, but advanced marvelously in the 20th century, and in the USA in particular. By the end of 2000, the poorest 80% of people in the USA owned just 15% of the country's wealth -- and that fell to 10% in the next five years.<br/><br/>By the 21st century, these financiers had reached an almost perfect capitalist state. They did nothing. They produced nothing. They gambled huge amounts of money on stock markets like roulette wheels, but hid it carefully when the tax-man came to call. When the countries of the world, driven to desperation by their collapsing incomes, eliminated tax havens, these financiers just bought up the nascent space industry and moved into orbit.<br/><br/>Noxium wasn't the first company to make money from space habitats -- in fact its main focus was on asteroid mining -- but its establishment of the so-called Ceres Cartel with the Empire Management mercenary group in the 2030s meant that it was quite soon the only business in town. Habitats that weren't launched with the cartel's approval had a horrible habit of being struck by micrometeorites, exploding on launch or directing themselves into a burn-up orbit while the occupants slept. The commercial war was bloody but understandably short-lived.<br/><br/>The Ceres Cartel held together for the best part of forty years, until 2075 when the first interstellar probes reported back from the superterran exoplanet Tau Ceti e. Though the planet was uninhabitable, the prospect of space colonization suddenly reawakened Noxium's dozing commercial instincts and plans for interstellar ships were put into effect. Unfortunately, Noxium foolishly neglected to take their military allies Imperium into their new venture, instead allying with the production facilities of the Solar Dynasty and the design geniuses of Togra University.<br/><br/>Imperium's vengeful raid on the Callisto headquarters of Noxium's mining operation killed off the Ceres Cartel totally. The Imperium vacuum troopers took the prototype ship -- intended for Noxium's own use -- which Imperium then used to head to Pandora. It's worth noting that though the Noxium board was angry at the Imperium for this, it was mainly that they hadn't realised space-piracy would be such a lucrative business model. Instead, they focused their ire on Noxium's own security section, who soon found that, whilst accountants might be boring people, it doesn't take much imagination to cancel your bonus and/or throw you out of an airlock.<br/><br/>Retrenching and belatedly establishing their own security force, Noxium built itself a new colony ship, and hastened for the new markets of Pandora, ripe for the exploitation of its physical, human and financial capital."/>

	<entry name="FanaticDescription" value="The Divine Ascension is a theocratic monarchy and the colorfully-named Lady Lilith Vermillion is its absolute monarch. Born as simple Lily Maroon in 2010s rural America, Lily's wild early years hardly gave signs that she would one day be regarded as next-to-god by billions; drinking, gambling, blackmail and more sordid sins all came naturally to her.<br/><br/>Her first steps on the path to godhood came, though, when a nerdy drinking buddy signed her up to a major social network as a prank. Never having used these, Lily saw, where few had before, the potential for social networks as a natural outgrowth of evangelical organizations -- and as a tool for blackmail.<br/><br/>Taking elements of major modern cults, and using her underworld connections, Lily founded the world's first entirely online religion in 2038. Then the second. And third. Intrigued by the success and experiencing a taste for power, she changed her name to Lilith Vermillion and with the help of Togra's off-shelf AI designers founded hundreds of new religions. Some riffing on old favorites like The Greek Autodocs Church, some entirely new, like Blessed Abduction, but all plugged deeply into user's online lives. Each one was subtly different, but all had Divine Ascension and the unity of all religions as their heart, their eventual revealed truth.<br/><br/>That wasn't Divine Ascension's biggest secret though. The precepts of the church were extremely hierarchical and to reach the next level of salvation, believers had to put their trust in their higher-ups -- revealing their darkest secrets as part of ascension rituals, projected live on the social network. Essentially, every step up the hierarchy knew the dirty secrets of every person below them. And Lady Vermillion, aided by data-mining AIs, sits at the top.<br/><br/>Now imagine trying to leave such a network. You're all being automatically blackmailed, your income siphoned, your friends and family incentivized to betray doubters so they can be 'healed' at the special reformation camps in Siberia. There's no way out, save to disappear entirely.<br/><br/>By the 2040s, Divine Ascension was one of the largest religions on earth. Some of the followers truly believed; those who didn't kept their mouths firmly shut. But now the really strange part started. Lilith, a grasping materialist since birth, finally found herself with the luxury to rest, think; and found that she genuinely had faith, in herself, as a god. Now this might have been a result of the brain trauma she received after an assassination attempt, and it didn’t change anything about the cruelty and authoritarianism of her organization – but it changed the religion’s aims. She was a god; now she wanted a planet of her own.<br/><br/>Using the fabulous wealth of a tithe drawn from a billion people, Lilith had Noxium build her a fabulous space cathedral, a Gothic rotational habitat that was decorated as a prayer wheel, turning the sun's rays into rotational force, and hence prayer, and incidentally gravity. With her faithful few, she retreated into meditative cryo-pods in the hub of the habitat. Here they lay, aging only slowly, waiting for the discovery of a world she could call her own -- and the science to get there.<br/><br/>In the 2080s, the Pandora announcement invigorated her religions. Vermillion's instructions were clear -- her cryo-pod and those of the faithful were loaded straight into her custom-built Noxium colonization ship and sent to the stars, while her fearful faithful prayed for her deliverance (and many secretly hoped she never came back).<br/><br/>On Pandora, Lady Vermillion sits at the top of a social pyramid that combines the worst parts of Facebook, Scientology and North Korea.  Her zealous followers worship her for being god's instrument to express his will among men. She believes it's her destiny to show her people the right path, and lead them to a prosperous future in a promised land. Pandora is that promised land. Woe betide any heathens who get in her way."/>

	<entry name="IndustriousDescription" value="The prevailing theme of the short twentieth century (1914-1991) was the clash of authoritarian ideologies. Communism, fascism and capitalism fought throughout the century, with none of them emerging with its reputation intact. Indeed, the only 'isms' that did emerge successfully were authoritarianism and pragmatism -- both as practiced effectively by the Chinese Communist party from the late 1930s. By always acting in the interest of the majority over the interest of any single individual, the Chinese state emerged with a brutally effective economy by the late 20th century.<br/><br/>But, as Plato observed, regimes always decay towards tyranny. Chinese communism was no exception, though the efforts of the National People's Congress to execute and subjugate overweening leaders to their authority until the early 2060s were impressively effective. It was only with the appointment of Sheng Xi as Chairman of the Central Guidance Commission for Building Spiritual Civilization that they made a misstep.<br/><br/>Like Caesar and Napoleon before him, Sheng Xi made carefully-brutal steps towards the suppression of resistance. The early steps are of little interest -- his birth in Xiamen, his rapid rise through the party and accession to the Politburo. However, his own business is of note -- a firm specializing in genetic manipulation (essential for progress in the ranks) used by the elite to guarantee children and sons (whispered to involve cloning technology for the more infertile cases). By the time of the final National Congress in 2062, Sheng was General Secretary and powerful -- too powerful in fact, so that rumors rumbled in the state media that the Congress would take him down a peg.<br/><br/>What happened at the final National Congress, no-one really knows. The state media blames the detonation of poison gas bombs on Uighur and Nepalese separatists, but we do know that after the event, Sheng's authority was unchallenged. He changed his title from General Secretary to Prime Minister and, to prevent further attacks on the new Congress, had them all shipped up to a new Noxium-built habitat in orbit about Saturn.<br/><br/>This habitat was, in fact, his pleasure palace, where complicit members lived a life of bliss. (No-one knows what happened to any dissidents, but there was always a large supply of shipboard protein.) With the consent of his Congress-slaves, Sheng changed the name of the country to the Solar Dynasty, and died in bliss, while his people suffered.<br/><br/>His clone-son, Yun Xi, became Prime Minister after him and it was he who took the Solar Dynasty to Pandora. Yun's people slaved in the shipyards of the asteroid belt for Noxium, turning the rare ores into the refined metals needed. His people also built every last interstellar transport, working long hours in leaky spacesuits, until they dropped. Togra had the designs, Noxium the resources, and Yun had the manpower.<br/><br/>Yun Xi, like his father, is concerned with the greatness of his people. They only know him as father of the country, the spiritual and physical successor to his father. But he seeks to remake the state in his image. His clones are seeded throughout the state, in positions of authority; indeed, the majority of the colonists taken to Pandora are Yun's clones too, with the other passengers just there as make-weights, in case genetic diversity is needed.<br/><br/>Yun's aim on Pandora is to build a perfect state, in his image -- strong, resolute and clear in purpose. He has already sold his state and his people to reach Pandora -- if every other living thing has to suffer for the greater goal too, so be it."/>
